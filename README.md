# FPGA UART Module

## Overview

This repository is intended to house a modular UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) implementation in VHDL. The goal is to create a reliable and configurable UART module suitable for various FPGA designs.

## Features

- [x] Configurable baud rates
- [x] Configurable oversampling

## Features (Planned)

- [ ] Majority voting
- [ ] Programmable character length (5, 6, 7, or 8 bit)
- [ ] Parity options (even, odd, or no parity)
- [ ] Stop bits (1, 1.5, or 2 stop bits)
- [ ] False start detection
- [ ] Line break generation and detection
- [ ] Error handling (framing errors, parity errors, overrun errors)
- [ ] Status reporting
- [ ] Control signaling

## Getting Started

This project is in the initial stages of development. Further documentation, including design details and usage instructions, will be added as the project progresses.
